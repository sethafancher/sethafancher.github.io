# Personal Portfolio Website (sethafancher.github.io)
During the listless summer months of 2020, I decided to learn basic HTML and CSS to create a personal portfolio website and host it on GitHub Pages. The website includes an introduction/about section, a resume, a projects page, and contact information.

The website can be accessed here: [sethafancher.github.io](https://sethafancher.github.io/)
