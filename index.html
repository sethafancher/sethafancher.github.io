            <h1>Seth Fancher</h1>
            <p>I am a sophomore pursuing a Bachelor of Science in 
                Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. 
                I am seeking a summer internship that will allow me to apply my experience 
                and knowledge in software development to enhance products or services 
                and personally grow as an engineer. </p>
